# photo-website

This is a plan for a photography portfolio website, which will probably remain empty for a while as I am busy with school stuff.

I think i might want to use rust for this and maybe solidjs or vuejs for frontend

## key ideas

mount images from icloud directly to server with icloud-for-linux

metadata and exif visualization and integration

custom delivery into scaffolding, deliver high quality images, visualize each section as it arrives

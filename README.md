# photo-website

This is a plan for a photography portfolio website, which will probably remain empty for a while as I am busy with school stuff.

I think i might want to use rust for this and maybe solidjs or vuejs for frontend

## key ideas

automatically pull from my photos folder in icloud

use gaussian splatting to make some 3d images and integrate a viewer

my own transfer protocol for images 
- lazy loading
- image streaming
- custom compression algorithm?

service workers for offline viewing?

metadata and exif visualization and integration
